The theoretical approach was developed by Gavin Poludniowski and Phil Evans at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. It is described in two papers published in the journal Medical Physics [1, 2].  
The Graphical User Interface for SpekCalc was developed by Fran√ßois deBlois, Guillaume Landry and Frank Verhaegen at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. It is described in a note published in the journal Physics in Medicine and Biology [3].
